Hi everyone, and welcome to Garda Lake, the largest lake in Italy and one  
of the most popular holiday  location in northern Italy!
Lake Garda is ideal for a tailor-made vacation,  for lovers of nature, sport, history and food. 
But this is the problem of Garda  Lake: to much stuff to do and to see,  
so you can get lost planning your trip.  In this video you’ll get 9 ideas to visit  
You can start by visiting the  towns of Sirmione and Peschiera,  
from Peschiera you can go by bike to Mantua,  visit Verona, the city of Romeo and Juliet,  
have relax and fun at the Riovalli Water Park,  see amazing animals in the Natura Viva Park,  
and finish your holiday in the picturesque  villages of Bardolino and Lazise.
Sirmione has a very long peninsula, which divides the lower part of the lake.
The main historical attraction of Sirmione are the so-called Grotte di Catullo,
the most striking example of a Roman private edifice discovered in northern Italy.
The Scaligero Castle (13th century). This is a rare example of medieval port fortification.
The main reason to visit Peschiera del Garda is to see his Venetian fortifications,
to enjoy the really small historical city centre,
and as a basis to move around.
The Mantua-Peschiera road  is the longest cycle path in Italy!
The journey is 37 km long, is flat  and can be done easily during the day.
You like artistic heritage?…you like opera??
You like William Shakespeare??? So, you’ll like Verona!
Two of William Shakespeare's plays are set in Verona:
Romeo and Juliet, of course, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona.
Verona is known all over the world as "the city of love”.
Oh Verona, the city of Romeo and Juliet, how you couldn’t visit it with your partner.
Parco Natura Viva is much more than a place to go and see animals. It’s the home for about 1500 animals!
You can go visiting all the maze of streets of the center
...and finally to go back to the shore of Garda Lake
where you can find on Thursday the local Market.
